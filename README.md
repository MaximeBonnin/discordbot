# discordbot

A first try to make a discord bot. I'm trying to have it do as many things as I can.
So far it includes working with a json database file, web scraping requests as well as simple minigames including dice rolling and gacha.

Next steps:
> 1. change the website used for scarping because it is incomplete DONE!
> 2. fill in more user info in the json
> 3. eventually try to host this thing somewhere online 
> 4. maybe add chess or poker

Any ideas for additional features are welcome!
